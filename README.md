# iSV Player Statues
A resource pack which adds statues based on the members of impulseSV's fan server SMP.

## Notes:
- The statues require either Optifine, CIT Resewn, or Chime in order to display properly.
- **If you use the MoreCulling mod, disable the Custom Item Frame Renderer or statues in item frames won't be displayed.**
- The pack removes the carved pumpkin overlay for optimal comfort in case you choose to wear a statue on your head.
- The statues can't be placed down normally, as CIT and Chime do not support adding block models. Instead, you can place them in item frames for a similar effect.
  - **iSV SMP members:** Check the **Server-Side Plugins and Datapacks** section of the iSV server rule book for info on making item frames invisible.

# iSV FAQ
**Q1:** How do I download the pack?

**A2:** Find the newest version under the "Releases" tab and click on the zip file. The correct file name will look something like this: _iSV Player Statues vx.x.x for 1.xx.x.zip_

**Q2:** Why do all of my statues look like carved pumpkins?

**A2:** This pack requires a mod compatible with either MCPatcher's CIT format or Chime's extended model predicate format in order to properly display items. Examples of mods which can do this include:
- OptiFine (Forge only)
- CIT Resewn (Fabric only)
- Chime (Fabric only)

**Q3:** When I place a statue in an item frame, it changes into a carved pumpkin. Why does that happen?

**A3:** If you have the MoreCulling mod installed, disable the "Custom Item Frame Renderer" setting in the config. This setting causes issues with CIT models.

**Q4:** Why does one of my statues look incomplete/have strange texture artifacts?

**A4:** Your statue's skin may be designed for the slim player model, but the pack assumes it uses the classic one. Let me know about that and I'll look into fixing it.

**Q5:** Can I place statues on the ground the same way I would with a block?

**A5:** No. The resource pack is only able to replace the item form of blocks. If you place a statue in the same way that you would place a regular block, it will revert into a carved pumpkin and **permanently** lose its model.

**Q6:** Is it safe to rename a statue in an anvil?

**A6:** No. The resource pack relies on the name of the item in order to function. If it is renamed it will lose its model.

**Q7:** Why do some of my statues appear while others do not?

**A7:** Make sure you have the resource pack updated to the latest version.

**Q8:** How do I know which users have been added to the pack?

**A8:** Check the [Statue List](Statue-List.md) to see which users already have statues added.

**Q9:** Can you add me to the pack?

**A9:** Outside of a few exceptions, only members of the iSV server will be added to the pack. If you are already a member of the server, you can make a request in the _iSV Statue Resource Pack Project_ channel of the iSV Discord to be added to the pack.
