# iSV-Player-Statues
A resource pack which adds statues based on the members of impulseSV's fan server SMP.

## Notes:
- The statues are added using Optifine's CIT format, meaning that although the pack works fully client-side, either Optifine or CIT Resewn is required for them to display properly. I may look into adding Chime support later once I've taken the time to learn more about it.
- If you use the MoreCulling mod, disable the Custom Item Frame Renderer or statues in item frames won't be displayed.
- The pack removes the carved pumpkin overlay because wearing your buddy on your head should not come with a handicap.
- The statues can't be placed down normally, as CIT only works on items. Instead, you can place them in item frames for a similar effect. **iSV SMP members:** Check the **Server-Side Plugins and Datapacks** section of the iSV server rule book for info on making item frames invisible.
