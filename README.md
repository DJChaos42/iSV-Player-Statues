# iSV-Player-Statues
A resource pack which adds statues based on the members of impulseSV's fan server SMP.

**Download the latest release [here](https://github.com/DJChaos42/iSV-Player-Statues/releases/download/1.0.1/iSV-Player-Statues-1.20.x-1.0.1.zip)**

## Notes:
- The statues require either Optifine, CIT Resewn, or Chime in order to display properly.
- If you use the MoreCulling mod, disable the Custom Item Frame Renderer or statues in item frames won't be displayed.
- The pack removes the carved pumpkin overlay for optimal comfort in case you choose to wear a statue on your head.
- The statues can't be placed down normally, as CIT and Chime do not support adding block models. Instead, you can place them in item frames for a similar effect.
  - **iSV SMP members:** Check the **Server-Side Plugins and Datapacks** section of the iSV server rule book for info on making item frames invisible.
